          Hey there! I'm Jason, and I love to build beautiful software
        </Title>
        <Text>
          Ever since my foray into computing, Iâ€™ve fallen in love with building
          projects that both look good and do good. I have seen the power of
          technology and how it can greatly better the lives of the less
          privileged. I have thus been dabbling in both coding and design work
          that make a difference.
