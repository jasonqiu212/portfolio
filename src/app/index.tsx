        Hey there! I'm Jason, and I love to build beautiful software

        Ever since my foray into computing, Iâ€™ve fallen in love with building
        projects that both look good and do good. I have seen the power of
        technology and how it can greatly better the lives of the less
        privileged. I have thus been dabbling in both coding and design work
        that make a difference.
